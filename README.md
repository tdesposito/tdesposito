![That's Me](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/368027?s=60&v=4) Hi, I'm Todd.

## Back Then
I've been writing software for 40 years, starting with 6502 assembler, moving 
into Basic, Pascal, C, Perl and C++.  More or less in that order. I jumped into
[Python](https://python.org) at least 15 years ago. Probably more like 20, but 
I don't recall when I first starting using Python in earnest. It was one of those
things which just crept up on me. I've also been building web sites for about
20 years. Yes, that's a long time, and yes,  we DID have the web 20 years ago,
but *boy* let me tell you, it was something entirely else in those days. 

## Right Now
These days, I like to work with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/),
[Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/), 
though I prefer to do most of the HTML/CSS/JavaScripty stuff as manually as I can. 
Still, nothing like a good framework when you can get one.

## Projects
I have a few projects I'm actively working on (and many more I'm not so active
on; I'm sure you feel me here), including:
* [DevPail] - a tool to isolate my projects' tooling into a Docker container
* some simple [Web-Components](https://github.com/tdesposito/EH-WebComponents)
* a python library for accessing the [Zoho Finance Suite API](https://github.com/tdesposito/pyZohoAPI)
* a framework for building [Raspberry Pi appliances](https://github.com/tdesposito/Pi-Appliance)
* and a [blog](https://toddesposito.com), cuz I guess that's cool again.

## I'm Available
I'm always looking for my next cool project, whether that be Open Source or a
paid consulting/development gig. Send me a note at [Todd@ToddEsposito.com](mailto://todd@toddesposito.com)
